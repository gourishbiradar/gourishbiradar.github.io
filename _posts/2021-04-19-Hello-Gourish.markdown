Hello World,

I am Gourish, a software developer and tech enthusiast. 
I will be mainly writing on the software developement practices and neat quirks of different languages that I use at work or personal projects.

I will try to regularly update about my personal projects here and give the idea behind my work. 

I am mainly a c++ developer and would be focusing on open source projects with c++ as the language used for the core of the project

Check out my github [gourishbiradar][gourishbiradar-github] for more info on the projects I am currently working on.
